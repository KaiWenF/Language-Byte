# Multi-Language Support Implementation Summary

Here's a summary of the changes made to implement multi-language support:

## 1. New Models Created
- `Language`: Represents a language with code, name, and speech code
- `LanguagePair`: Combines source and target languages with their word pairs
- Reorganized models into individual files for better maintainability
  - `WordPair.swift`: For word pair model
  - `LanguagePair.swift`: For language pair and language models
  - Removed `Models.swift` to eliminate duplicate declarations

## 2. Data Management
- Created `LanguageDataManager` to load language data from JSON
- Added support for both legacy format and new multi-language format
- Implemented fallback mechanism when language_data.json isn't found
- Moved to Managers directory for better organization

## 3. Updated WordViewModel
- Added `selectedLanguagePair` and `availableLanguagePairs` properties
- Implemented `loadLanguageData()`, `selectLanguagePair()`, etc.
- Updated speech functions to use dynamic language codes
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing features
- Added support for persistent language selection via AppStorage
- Improved language loading priority to respect user selections
- Added dynamic voice selection based on target language

## 4. New Views
- Added `LanguageSelectionView` for choosing language pairs
- Updated `ContentView` to show current language pair and language switching button
- Enhanced `SettingsView` with more options
- Restructured ContentView for better maintainability:
  - Split into smaller, reusable components
  - Improved navigation flow
  - Better separation of UI and logic
- Added ScrollView to MainView for better organization of multiple buttons
- Implemented proper environment object sharing between views

## 5. UI Improvements
- Improved main screen interface with better spacing and organization
- Created dynamic voice selection UI that updates based on target language
- Added animations for smooth transitions between languages
- Enhanced settings screen with context-sensitive voice options
- Added "Favorite Words" and "Settings" buttons to MainView
- Positioned app title to avoid overlapping with system time
- Improved reusability of buttons with consistent styling

## 6. Voice Selection
- Implemented dynamic voice selection based on target language
- Added persistable voice preferences using AppStorage
- Created fallback mechanism to system default voices
- Added voice validation when switching languages
- Improved UI refresh when changing languages

## 7. Data Format
- Created comprehensive `multilingual_words.json` with translations in Spanish, French, German, and Japanese
- Maintained compatibility with existing `words.json` format
- Organized into clear categories: verbs, food, family, colors, numbers, and phrases

## 8. Daily Dashboard and Word of the Day Feature
- Created new `DailyDashboardView` to display daily progress and Word of the Day
- Integrated with `MainView` navigation using an orange-tinted button
- Implemented Word of the Day functionality in `WordViewModel` with auto-refresh logic
- Added persistent storage using `@AppStorage` properties for Word of the Day data
- Created progress tracking for daily study goals
- Removed the obsolete `ContentView.swift` file and replaced with `MainView` as main entry point
- Enhanced dashboard with contextual navigation to other app sections

## 9. Notification System
- Implemented customizable daily notifications for Word of the Day
- Added notification time configuration with DatePicker in Settings
- Created notification toggle with visual indicators for on/off states
- Added intelligent preview text showing next scheduled notification time
- Implemented special handling for disabled notifications (hour = -1)
- Added "Disable Notifications" button for quick access in Settings
- Integrated notification scheduling directly with user actions
- Added helper method to format notification times based on device settings
- Added notifications permission request on app startup

## 10. Text Scrolling Improvements
- Implemented advanced scrolling mechanism for long words/phrases
- Created custom `SimpleScrollingModifier` with optimized animation cycles
- Resolved text truncation issues that previously showed ellipsis (...)
- Added intelligent display logic that only scrolls text when needed
- Optimized scrolling speed parameters based on text length
- Implemented faster animation cycling for better readability
- Fixed text measurement and container width handling
- Ensured full text visibility without truncation or clipping
- Added smooth transitions between scrolling and centered text modes
- Modified container layout to maximize available space for text

## 11. Automated Unit Tests
- Implemented comprehensive test suite using Swift Testing framework
- Created modular test structure with separate files for each component type:
  - `ModelTests.swift`: Tests for WordPair, Language, and LanguagePair models
  - `ManagerTests.swift`: Tests for LanguageDataManager and NotificationManager
  - `WordViewModelTests.swift`: Tests for core app logic and state management
  - `UITests.swift`: Basic tests for view initialization and rendering
- Added test helpers and mock data in `TestHelpers.swift`
- Implemented tests for critical functionality:
  - Model initialization, equality, and coding/decoding
  - Data manager loading and filtering capabilities
  - ViewModel state management and user interactions
  - Word selection and language pair switching
  - Category filtering and favorites management
  - Word of the Day functionality
- Created adaptable tests that work with actual app data
- Added proper test assertions using the #expect syntax
- Implemented safeguards for tests with external dependencies

## 12. Bug Fixes
- Resolved duplicate file references for MarqueeText.swift
- Fixed multiple @main entry point conflicts
- Eliminated invalid redeclaration errors for model types
- Corrected SwiftUI view structure issues, particularly with padding modifiers
- Addressed app initialization conflicts between LanguageByteApp and Language_ByteApp
- Fixed language selection persistence issues
- Resolved UI refresh problems when changing languages
- Corrected voice selection updating issues
- Fixed EnvironmentObject access issues with WordViewModel

## Implementation Challenges
- Import issues between files (circular dependencies)
- UIKit references in WatchKit environment
- Need for a single source of truth for model types
- SwiftUI view hierarchies and modifier application
- State management across multiple views
- Ensuring persistence of user preferences
- Coordinating notifications with app state
- Managing EnvironmentObject references across different view hierarchies
- Setting up proper test environment for WatchKit applications

This implementation allows users to switch between language pairs while maintaining all existing functionality including favorites, text-to-speech, and category filtering. The codebase is now better organized with cleaner separation of concerns and improved maintainability. The app provides a smooth, intuitive user experience with proper persistence of user preferences across app launches. The addition of Word of the Day features and customizable notifications significantly enhances the app's ability to help users learn languages through regular, scheduled practice. The automated test suite ensures reliability and helps prevent regressions when making future changes.
