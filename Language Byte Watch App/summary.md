## 11. Automated Unit Tests
- Implemented comprehensive test suite using Swift Testing framework
- Created modular test structure with separate files for each component type:
  - `ModelTests.swift`: Tests for WordPair, Language, and LanguagePair models
  - `ManagerTests.swift`: Tests for LanguageDataManager and NotificationManager
  - `WordViewModelTests.swift`: Tests for core app logic and state management

## Implementation Challenges
- Import issues between files (circular dependencies)
- UIKit references in WatchKit environment
- Need for a single source of truth for model types
- SwiftUI view hierarchies and modifier application
- State management across multiple views
- Ensuring persistence of user preferences
- Coordinating notifications with app state
- Managing EnvironmentObject references across different view hierarchies
- Setting up proper test environment for WatchKit applications

This implementation allows users to switch between language pairs while maintaining all existing functionality including favorites, text-to-speech, and category filtering. The codebase is now better organized with cleaner separation of concerns and improved maintainability. The app provides a smooth, intuitive user experience with proper persistence of user preferences across app launches. The addition of Word of the Day features and customizable notifications significantly enhances the app's ability to help users learn languages through regular, scheduled practice. The automated test suite ensures reliability and helps prevent regressions when making future changes.
