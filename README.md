#### Premium Feature Gating & Paywall Integration

The app now supports **premium features** that are only accessible to users with an active subscription. This is managed through a paywall system and a premium access manager, allowing you to offer advanced features as part of a paid upgrade.

**Key Components:**
- **PremiumAccessManager:** Singleton that checks subscription status and feature availability.
- **PaywallView:** Dedicated view for premium upsell, purchase, and restore.
- **Feature Gating in UI:** Premium features (Weekly Review, Multiple Languages, Advanced Categories, AI Word Bundles) are locked for non-subscribers, with seamless paywall presentation.
- **MockStoreKitManager & MockPremiumAccessManager:** For robust, isolated testing of premium logic.

**How It Works:**
- When a user tries to access a premium feature, the app checks their subscription status.
- If not subscribed, the paywall is shown, offering purchase/restore.
- Upon successful purchase/restore, premium features unlock immediately.
- All logic is fully testable with mocks.

**Premium Features Gated:**
